    HALKEN LZ
    v1.00

    "White Guy That Don't Smile"

Description:

    Herein lies a simplified, easy to read skeleton of the
    Lempel-Ziv routine found in the Game Boy Advance SDK tool,
    "agbcomp", using a mix of hypothetical and theoretical
    alterations best suited to reproduce the relevant subset of
    data from decoded "vpk0" data samples.

#####################################################################

Motive:

    Nearly 20 years ago, an individual under the alias "CaitSith2"
    successfully reverse-engineered the vpk0 format used by the
    Nintendo e-Reader for the Game Boy Advance.

    This development is certainly no small feat, however, some
    individuals are curious as to whether or not they themselves
    can <fully> reverse-engineer the format, myself included,
    focusing on 1:1 accuracy.

    As of February 2022, only the LZ portion of the format has
    been replicated. The Huffman format has yet to be cracked.

Special Mentions:

    HAL Laboratory:
        Japan's IBM, to say the least.
        Their vpk0 format keeps me up at night knowing I may never
        be able to deduce their Huffman method....

    CaitSith2:
        Big Brain behind the e-Reader homebrew tools.
        (After comparing your code with what was reproduced via
         Ghidra using a dumped e-Reader ROM for reference, the
         similarities are borderline identical despite the
         15 year gap. Tee-hee.)

    tehzz:
        Recognized for also expressing interest in fully
        reverse-engineering HAL's intriguing rendition of the
        Deflate algorithm.
